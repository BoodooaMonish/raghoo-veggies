### How to launch the project {#launch}

1. Clone/ Download the repository and extract it into your desired folder.

2. Open a terminal inside the desired folder and then in the terminal, type:

```sh
cd raghoo-veggies-master
npm install
```

To run in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

**UNSOLVED ISSUE:** the 'api' folder and the 'veggies' folder should always be inside the dist for the website to run --> "parcel" cannot seem to automatically add these folder to the dist folder
